# Reconstruct Task History

## Description

Establish a structured task history within the `instructions/` directory to track the application's development.
Previously, development proceeded without a formal task tracking system. This task aims to retroactively create that history.

## Objectives

-   Analyze the contents of the `prompts/` directory to understand past requirements.
-   Review the git commit history to identify implemented features and changes.
-   Create corresponding task directories in `instructions/tasks/` for completed work.
-   Ensure task descriptions align with the actual code implementation, which may have evolved from the initial prompts.

## Context

-   `prompts/`: Contains the original agent prompts used during development.
-   `instructions/tasks/`: The target directory for the structured task history.
-   **Git History**: Serves as the source of truth for implementation details and timelines.
