# Resolution

## Summary

Reconstructed the development history by analyzing the `prompts/` folder and git commit logs. Created structured task folders for past work to align with the new `instructions/tasks` workflow.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Analyzed History**: Correlated `prompts/prompt_1.txt` through `prompt_6.txt` with git commits to identify key feature sets and timelines.
2.  **Created Task Folders**: Generated the following task directories with `README.md` (requirements) and `RESOLUTION.md` (implementation summary):
    - `20260122190000_implement_video_upload_flow`: Initial upload flow and DB schema.
    - `20260123170000_home_page_asset_tiles`: Home page UI and asset listing.
    - `20260123200000_asset_details_page`: Asset details and video playback.
    - `20260124165000_refactor_frontend_structure`: Frontend architecture refactor (core/pages/shared).
    - `20260124180000_groups_page_and_feature_flags`: Groups feature and feature flagging system.
    - `20260124213000_upload_page_slides_transition`: UI update for upload page using slides.

## Verification

- Verified that new task folders contain accurate descriptions based on the original prompts.
- Verified that resolution files link to actual git commits and code changes present in the workspace.
